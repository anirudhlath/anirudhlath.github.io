<h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
<h2>Summary Statement</h2>
<P>The quality that makes me unique is grasping concepts and gaining a solid understanding of any new topic, 
    environment, or situation. My method of thinking is very chronological and yet quite creative. I can pay acute attention 
    to details which allows me to systematically plan and understand complex topics and apply my problem-solving skills 
    in an innovative fashion. Experienced and exposed in creating many projects of different genres, such as the arts and 
    the sciences, allows me to think out-of-the-box to solve any given problem. I have a sophisticated technical skillset 
    due to my lifetime experience of distributed computing that has allowed me to gain a better understanding of 
    technology and the importance of its reliability!</P>
